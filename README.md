| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| \`id\` | uuid | Primary key (auto-generated) |
| \`user_id\` | uuid | Links the expense to the logged-in user |
| \`description\` | text | What the expense was for |

| \`category\` | text | Spending category (e.g. Food & Drink) |
| \`date\` | date | When the expense happened |
| \`created_at\` | timestamptz | When the row was created (auto-generated) |

> 🔒 **Row Level Security (RLS)** is enabled so users can only read, edit, and delete their own expenses.
